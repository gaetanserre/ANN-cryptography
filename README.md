## Artificial Neural Network cryptography

### Algorithms so far
+ Symmetric algorithm where the key is the neural network (weights and architecture) (autoencoder)

### Algorithms to be done
+ Symmetric algorithm where the key is the neural network AND a bit sequence (autoencoder)
+ Symmetric algorithm where each character is assigned to a random sequence of bits (regression)
